## What is HoWCoM?

The ability to collaboratively engineer models of systems has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Apart from becoming multidisciplinary, engineering teams are also getting more and more distributed in space and time. The lack of physical presence forces engineers to rely on digital means of collaboration. Given the recent trends in the research and development of collaborative MDE tools, it is high time for their **hands-on** evaluation.

HoWCoM is just that:  a **hands-on** workshop---i.e., a hybrid between regular workshops and tool contests---focusing on the tool aspects of collaboration.

The workshop intends to leverage the opportunity of working with physically co-located modeling experts on the topic of collaborative MDSE, and offers a variety of [submission formats](cfp) to fit the need of the diverse community around the topic.

## Who is HoWCoM for?

HoWCoM aims to bring together a wide spectrum of professionals working on collaborative modeling topics. We anticipate academic researchers, industrial practitioners, and people between these two ends of the spectrum to be present at the workshop. Tool builders and adopters may find the workshop interesting because of its dedicated tool demonstration session.
